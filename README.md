# LittleProgrammer

## Introduction

*This was part of my bachelor's final work.*

**This is a demo program to help parents find inexpensive programming teachers among university students group for their children.** The backdrop is that nowadays more and more parents in China want their children to learn programming from an early age, but do not have the financial resources to pay for a tutor. Overall, it's like a takeaway app, but instead of food takeaway, it's teacher "takeaway". 

Sorry for the app is in Chinese. Luckily, I wrote a document to demonstrate each part of the app, see [[Project Document - Little Programmer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14jBTFj4QHoKuKyTRamkEjg2ZwZ7OXrmqpzKFPS0lhdE/edit?usp=sharing)].

## Additional notes

*The app work well on swift 4.2 and iOS 14.6, but there is no guarantee that it will work perfectly with the newer iOS and swift version. Some of the images in the app are from unsplash. The app contains some code and cocoapod framework from the internet. This project is my first iOS development project and is something I am learning as I go along rather than starting after a systematic study. Therefore, there are many irregularities in the code, such as problems with the allocation of code in the MVC design pattern, some viewcontrollers did not use extension to apply delegate protocol and so on.*
